Assignment 6A  
The goal of 6A is to build out the HTML+CSS of a shopping cart, add some JS to the Product 
Detail page to support different customization options, and to add some JS to show feedback for 
items being added to the shopping cart. 
1. Create a NEW page. 
● The page should be a Shopping cart page where users can view items in their 
cart. Include the following prototypes: a low fidelity prototype, a high fidelity 
prototype, and an implementation in HTML + CSS. Modify your existing web 
store files as needed. 
○ If you had a shopping cart page already, choose a new type of page to 
implement (Special Offers, Order Tracking, etc.). You need to design high 
fidelity prototypes, and an implementation in HTML+CSS (no JavaScript). 
This is to ensure everyone does the same amount of work for this 
assignment. The remainder of the assignment that uses Javascript to add 
functionality will be implemented on the shopping cart page.

2. Create NEW features for your site. 
● The user can modify options on the Product Detail page (the size, quantity, etc.). -Radio buttons or dropdown
● The Product Detail page should change according to the user’s selection. Here is 
the feedback you should implement per shop: 
○ Bun Bun: For example, for a specific product (e.g., Walnut cinnamon roll), 
users can choose the any combination of the following variations: number 
of rolls and the glazing. Example combination: Walnut cinnamon roll with 
Vanilla-milk glazing, 12 pack. mock
○ Muddy Paws: For example, for a specific product (e.g., cat harness), 
users can choose the any combination of the following variations: size 
and color. Example combination: Tiny Fire Orange Cat Harness 
○ Fluff Stuff: For example, for a specific product, users can choose the any 
combination of the following variations: yarn color and filling. Example 
combination: Memory foam Round pillow in Morning Haze. 

For each shop, the page should update with the details of that product (i.e. - Add eventlistener and update size color and image
update size, color and image). This should NOT be a new HTML file. Use 
JavaScript to implement this functionality. 
● The user can add products to their shopping cart. There should be some visual 
indication to the user of how many items they have in their shopping cart for each 
page showing the shopping cart link. - addeventlistener for add to cart click, then update counter? update cart icon (Cart list item div)
