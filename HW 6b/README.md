1. Adding more functionality to the website.
● The user should be able to view their shopping cart on a Shopping Cart page, see the items they selected, and remove the items they no longer want.
● The shopping cart page should reflect the user’s actual product selections.
● You do NOT need to implement the checkout process.
2. Write a one (or more) paragraph reflection (due with Assignment 6B)
● What challenges or bugs did you encounter?
● How did you overcome these challenges?
3. What programming concepts did you learn as a part of the assignment?
● Illustrate at least 5 concepts with an example.

Add a “wishlist” functionality. For this feature, users can add products to their wishlist and view their wishlist (either on the shopping cart page or a separate page). (max 3pts)
